# Fb-Feed-Detoxifier

Facebook detoxifier is a chrome extension that I started developing during the COVHACK2020 hackathon to detect the facebook posts
and send the contents to the REST API developed using Nodejs to perform the sentiment analysis and detect any profanity based
on which the DOM Elements in the page gets highlighted. 

## Upcomming Plans for the Project. 

Currently, the node api consumes third party library to perform the sentiment analysis on the contents of posts. However, the 
upcoming plan for the project is to work with NLTK natural language processing library and develop the 
multinomial text classifier using keras for content classification. 

## Important Information. 

The objective of this project is not to scrap the content and perform sentiment analysis on public data but rather it is done for learning purposes only. I donot store any information in any database or file system and respect the privacy of people.
