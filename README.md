# Fb-Feed-Detoxifier

Facebook detoxifier is a chrome extension that I developed during the COVHACK2020 hackathon to detect the facebook posts
and send the contents to the REST Api developed using Nodejs to perform the sentiment analysis and detect any profanity based
on which the DOM Elements in the page gets highlighted. 

## Upcomming Plans for the Project. 

Currently, the node api consumes third party library to perform the sentiment analysis on the contents of posts. However, the 
upcomming plan for the project is to work with NLTK natural language processing library and develop the 
multinomial text classifier using keras for content classification.
